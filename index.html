<p>Awareness is key. It takes presence and patience and fortunately (or not, depending on how you look at it) we all get plenty of opportunities to practice. In the case of the unconscious driver (which admittedly still irritates the crap out of this former New Yorker) I recognize that it’s an opportunity for me to look at where I could be more conscious in my own life. Or sometimes it’s just a message for me to slow down. The bottom line is that we can look at these events as either fertilizer or a pile of poop.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="26"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="28"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="29"><span data-reactid="30"><!-- react-empty: 31 --><h2 data-reactid="32"><a data-reactid="33">A Well Nurtured Life</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="36"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="37"></div></section></div></div>
